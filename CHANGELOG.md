## Recent Updates (June 17, 2025)

### Assignment Management System Fixes

#### Fixed Issues:
1. **Non-Functional Assignment Management Buttons**
   - Problem: Buttons weren't responding to clicks
   - Root Cause: JavaScript selectors missing `mt-` prefix
   - Solution: Updated all button IDs in `assignment.js` to match HTML template

2. **Auto-Assignment "No candidates or jury members found" Error**
   - Problem: Function reported no data despite having 497 candidates and 22 jury members
   - Root Cause: Missing database queries in `auto_assign()` function
   - Solution: Added proper `get_posts()` queries to fetch candidates and jury members

3. **Assignment Display Issues (0 Assignments Shown)**
   - Problem: Dashboard showed 0 assignments despite data existing
   - Root Causes:
     - `mt_get_assigned_candidates()` returning IDs instead of post objects
     - SQL query checking non-existent `is_draft` column
     - Type mismatches between strings and integers
   - Solutions:
     - Updated function to return post objects by default
     - Fixed `mt_has_draft_evaluation()` to use user meta
     - Ensured consistent integer handling for IDs

4. **Code Organization**
   - Problem: Inline CSS and JavaScript in assignment template
   - Solution: Separated into proper files:
     - `admin/views/assignment-template.php` - Clean HTML only
     - `assets/assignment.css` - All styles  
     - `assets/assignment.js` - All JavaScript functionality

#### New Features Added:
1. **Manual Assignment Functionality**
   - Added modal interface for manual candidate-jury assignments
   - Created AJAX handler `mt_manual_assign()` 
   - Supports multiple jury member selection
   - Validates candidates and jury members before assignment

2. **Assignment Data Structure**
   - Assignments stored as serialized arrays in post meta
   - Meta key: `_mt_assigned_jury_members`
   - Format: Array of integer jury member IDs
   - Example: `a:3:{i:0;i:123;i:1;i:456;i:2;i:789;}`

#### Technical Details:
- **Files Modified:**
  - `includes/class-mt-ajax-handlers.php` - Added assignment handlers
  - `includes/mt-utility-functions.php` - Fixed helper functions
  - `admin/views/assignment-template.php` - Cleaned up template
  - `mobility-trailblazers.php` - Added script localization
  
- **Files Created:**
  - `assets/assignment.js` - Complete assignment management JS
  - `assets/assignment.css` - Assignment interface styles

#### Data Cleanup Function:
```php
function mt_fix_assignment_data() {
    // Ensures all assignment IDs are integers
    // Cleans up any string/integer type mismatches
    // Run once after update to fix existing data
}
```
