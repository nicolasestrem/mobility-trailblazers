## Archive Folder

The `/archive/` folder contains original documentation files that were consolidated. These are kept for reference but should not be updated. All new documentation should go into the appropriate consolidated file.

### Archived Files

- Separate debug center documents
- Version-specific developer guides
- Individual photo integration guides
- Session summaries and timelines

## Documentation Standards

### When Adding Documentation

1. **Choose the Right File**: Add to the most appropriate consolidated file
2. **Update Table of Contents**: Each file has a TOC that should be kept current
3. **Include Version Info**: Note the version when features are added
4. **Use Consistent Formatting**: Follow the existing markdown style
5. **Cross-Reference**: Link to other docs when relevant

### Markdown Guidelines

- Use proper heading hierarchy (# for title, ## for main sections)
- Include code blocks with language specification
- Use tables for structured data
- Add "Last Updated" dates when making changes
- Include practical examples where possible

## Search Tips

To find specific information quickly:

1. **Use file search** (Ctrl+F) within the appropriate consolidated file
2. **Check the Table of Contents** at the top of each file
3. **Review FILE-INDEX.md** to locate specific code files
4. **Check changelog.md** for when features were added

## Contributing

When contributing documentation:

1. Make changes in the consolidated files, not the archive
2. Update the "Last Updated" date at the top of the file
3. Add your changes to the changelog if significant
4. Ensure cross-references are still valid
5. Test any code examples you add

## Support
