# Auto-Assign Feature Fix Summary

## Issue
The Auto-Assign feature was partially working - assignments were being created in the database but not showing on the Assignment Management page.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Variable Mismatch in Template**
   - File: `templates/admin/assignments.php`
   - Issue: Template fetched `$all_assignments` but tried to use `$assignments` in the table rendering loop
   - Fixed: Changed `$assignments` to `$all_assignments` in the loop

2. **Missing Repository Instance**
   - File: `templates/admin/assignments.php`
   - Issue: Template tried to use `$evaluation_repo` which wasn't instantiated
   - Fixed: Added `$evaluation_repo = new \MobilityTrailblazers\Repositories\MT_Evaluation_Repository();`

3. **Incorrect AJAX URL**
   - File: `assets/js/admin.js`
   - Issue: JavaScript was using `mt_admin.url` instead of `mt_admin.ajax_url` for AJAX requests
   - Fixed: Changed all instances of `mt_admin.url` to `mt_admin.ajax_url` in:
     - `submitAutoAssignment()` method
     - `bulkRemove()` method
     - `bulkReassign()` method
     - `bulkExport()` method

## Files Modified

1. **templates/admin/assignments.php**
   - Fixed variable name from `$assignments` to `$all_assignments`
   - Added evaluation repository instantiation

2. **assets/js/admin.js**
   - Fixed AJAX URL references (4 instances)

## Testing Created

Created `test-assignments.php` to verify:
- Database connectivity
- Assignment creation and retrieval
- Table structure
- Repository functionality

## Result

The Auto-Assign feature should now work correctly:
1. Assignments are created in the database via AJAX
2. Page reloads after successful assignment
3. Assignments are properly displayed in the table on the Assignment Management page

## Next Steps

1. Test the Auto-Assign feature with both "Balanced" and "Random" methods
2. Verify assignments appear correctly after creation
3. Check that bulk operations work with the newly displayed assignments
4. Clean up the test file (`test-assignments.php`) after verification
