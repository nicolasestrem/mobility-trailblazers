# JavaScript Refactoring - Evaluations Page
## Date: 2025-01-14

### Overview
Refactored the JavaScript code from the evaluations admin page by extracting inline scripts from the PHP template and encapsulating them in a dedicated manager object within the main admin.js file.

### Changes Made

#### 1. **admin.js** - Added MTEvaluationManager
- Created new `MTEvaluationManager` object following the established modular pattern
- Encapsulated all evaluation-related JavaScript functionality:
  - `init()` - Initializes the manager and binds events
  - `bindEvents()` - Sets up all event listeners
  - `viewEvaluationDetails()` - Handles viewing evaluation details (placeholder for AJAX implementation)
  - `handleSelectAll()` - Manages select all checkbox functionality
  - `updateSelectAllCheckbox()` - Updates select all state based on individual checkboxes
  - `handleBulkAction()` - Processes bulk actions (approve, reject, reset to draft, delete)
  - `getConfirmMessage()` - Returns appropriate confirmation messages for each action
  - `performBulkAction()` - Executes AJAX call for bulk operations

#### 2. **evaluations.php** - Removed Inline JavaScript
- Removed entire `<script>` block from bottom of template
- Kept all HTML structure and PHP logic intact
- Maintained CSS styles for status indicators

#### 3. **Conditional Initialization**
Added detection logic in main `$(document).ready()` function to check for evaluations page:
```javascript
if ($('.wrap h1:contains("Evaluations")').length > 0 && 
    $('.wp-list-table').length > 0 &&
    $('input[name="evaluation[]"]').length > 0) {
    MTEvaluationManager.init();
}
```

### Benefits
1. **Better Code Organization**: All JavaScript now in centralized location
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to debug and extend functionality
3. **Performance**: JavaScript is now cacheable and minifiable
4. **Consistency**: Follows same pattern as MTAssignmentManager
5. **Separation of Concerns**: PHP template focuses on presentation, JS handles behavior

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify evaluations page loads without JavaScript errors
- [ ] Test "View Details" button functionality
- [ ] Test individual checkbox selection
- [ ] Test "Select All" checkbox functionality
- [ ] Test bulk actions (approve, reject, reset to draft, delete)
- [ ] Verify AJAX calls work correctly
- [ ] Check console for initialization messages
- [ ] Confirm no functionality was lost in refactoring

- `/assets/js/admin.js` - Main JavaScript file with new MTEvaluationManager
- `/templates/admin/evaluations.php` - Cleaned template without inline scripts

### Notes
- The "View Details" functionality still shows an alert as it was marked TODO in original code
- All i18n strings are preserved through PHP localization
- AJAX endpoints remain unchanged (`mt_bulk_evaluation_action`)
- Console logging added for debugging initialization

### Future Improvements
- Implement full AJAX loading for evaluation details modal
- Add loading spinners for better UX during AJAX operations
- Consider adding pagination support
- Add export functionality similar to assignments page
