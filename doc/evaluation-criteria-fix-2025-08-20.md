# Evaluation Criteria Display Fix
**Date:** 2025-08-20  
**Version:** 2.5.35  
**Issue:** Missing candidate evaluation criteria on jury evaluation pages

## Problem Statement
The jury evaluation pages were missing important candidate information that was displayed on the individual candidate profile pages. Specifically, the detailed evaluation criteria text for each of the 5 scoring categories was not visible to jury members during evaluation.

## Investigation Results
- **Affected Scope:** 100% of candidates (48/48)
- **Root Cause:** The evaluation form template was looking for content in empty fields (`_mt_description_full`, `post_content`)
- **Actual Data Location:** Content exists in individual criterion meta fields (`_mt_criterion_courage`, `_mt_criterion_innovation`, etc.)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Data Retrieval Enhancement
**File:** `templates/frontend/jury-evaluation-form.php`
- Added retrieval of all 5 individual evaluation criterion meta fields
- Fields retrieved:
  - `_mt_criterion_courage` - Mut & Pioniergeist
  - `_mt_criterion_innovation` - Innovationsgrad  
  - `_mt_criterion_implementation` - Umsetzungskraft & Wirkung
  - `_mt_criterion_relevance` - Relevanz für die Mobilitätswende
  - `_mt_criterion_visibility` - Vorbildfunktion & Sichtbarkeit

### 2. Display Section Addition
**File:** `templates/frontend/jury-evaluation-form.php`
- Added new "Bewertungskriterien Details" section
- Positioned between candidate showcase and evaluation form
- Displays each criterion in color-coded cards with icons
- Only shows criteria that have content

### 3. Styling Implementation
**File:** `assets/css/mt-evaluation-forms.css`
- Added `.mt-criteria-info-section` container styles
- Created `.mt-criteria-info-grid` responsive grid layout
- Styled `.mt-criterion-info-card` with:
  - Color-coded left borders matching scoring section
  - Hover effects for better interactivity
  - Icon and title headers
  - Readable content typography
- Added mobile responsiveness (single column on small screens)

## Visual Design
Each criterion card features:
- **Color-coded border** matching the scoring section colors
- **Icon** representing the criterion type
- **Title** in German as per localization requirements
- **Content** displaying the specific evaluation text for that candidate
- **Hover effect** for enhanced user experience

## Testing Results
- ✅ Tested with Anna-Theresa Korbutt (ID: 4838)
- ✅ Tested with Alexander Möller (ID: 4835)
- ✅ Cache cleared and changes verified on staging
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness confirmed
- ✅ All 5 criteria displaying correctly when data exists

## Impact
This fix ensures jury members have access to detailed context about each candidate's achievements and qualifications while scoring, leading to:
- More informed evaluation decisions
- Better understanding of scoring criteria
- Consistent evaluation standards across all jury members
- Improved user experience for the jury evaluation workflow

## Files Modified
1. `templates/frontend/jury-evaluation-form.php` - Added data retrieval and display section
2. `assets/css/mt-evaluation-forms.css` - Added styling for criteria information cards

## Database Query Optimization
No database schema changes required. The fix utilizes existing meta fields that were already populated during the candidate import process.

## Backwards Compatibility
This change is fully backwards compatible and will gracefully handle candidates without evaluation criteria data (though currently all 48 candidates have this data).
