# Candidate Profile Display Fixes
**Version:** 2.4.2  
**Date:** January 16, 2025  
**Developer:** Assistant

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Excessive Top Spacing
**Problem:** The candidate profile pages had too much empty space at the top in the hero section.

**Solution:** 
- Reduced hero section padding from `80px 0 60px` to `40px 0 30px`
- Removed `min-height` constraint that was forcing unnecessary height
- Reduced photo frame size from 280px to 240px for better proportion
- Adjusted profile name font size from 3.5rem to 3rem
- Pulled content section up slightly with negative margin

### 2. Evaluation Criteria Text Formatting
**Problem:** The text in the "Evaluation Criteria" boxes was bunched together without proper paragraph breaks and formatting.

**Solution:**
- Added `wpautop()` function to all evaluation criteria content to automatically add paragraph tags
- Applied CSS `white-space: pre-wrap` to preserve line breaks
- Set proper line height and spacing for better readability
- Fixed text wrapping with `word-wrap: break-word`

### 3. Missing Social Link Icons
**Problem:** Icons before LinkedIn and Website links were not displaying properly.

**Solution:**
- Ensured dashicons are loaded on frontend by adding `wp_enqueue_style('dashicons')`
- Added class names 'linkedin' and 'website' to social links for better targeting
- Changed website icon from `dashicons-admin-site` to `dashicons-admin-site-alt3`
- Added fallback styles for icons in case dashicons don't load

## Files Modified

### 1. Created New CSS File
**File:** `assets/css/candidate-profile-fixes.css`
- Contains all CSS fixes for spacing, formatting, and icons
- Properly organized with clear sections and comments
- Includes responsive design adjustments

### 2. Updated Template Files
**File:** `templates/frontend/single/single-mt_candidate.php`
- Added `wpautop()` wrapper to all evaluation criteria content
- Added class names to social links for better styling
- Changed website icon class

**File:** `templates/frontend/jury-evaluation-form.php`
- Added class names to social links
- Changed website icon class for consistency

### 3. Updated Plugin Core
**File:** `includes/core/class-mt-plugin.php`
- Added dashicons enqueue to frontend
- Added new CSS file to enqueue list with proper dependencies
- Ensured styles load in correct order

## Technical Details

### CSS Load Order
1. `dashicons` (WordPress core)
2. `mt-frontend` (base styles)
3. `mt-enhanced-candidate-profile` (enhanced profile styles)
4. `mt-candidate-profile-fixes` (fixes and overrides)

### Dependencies
- The fixes CSS file depends on both frontend and enhanced profile styles
- All styles depend on dashicons for icon display

## Testing Results
✅ Reduced top spacing - Hero section is now more compact  
✅ Properly formatted evaluation criteria text with paragraph breaks  
✅ Working social link icons (LinkedIn and Website)  
✅ Responsive design maintained  
✅ Print styles adjusted  

## Browser Compatibility
- Tested on Chrome (primary)
- CSS uses standard properties for wide browser support
- Fallback styles included for icons

## Future Considerations
1. Consider migrating from dashicons to a more modern icon library (Font Awesome, Feather Icons)
2. Further optimize spacing for mobile devices
3. Add animation options for criteria cards
4. Consider lazy loading for images

## Rollback Instructions
If issues arise, you can rollback by:
1. Remove or comment out the enqueue lines for `mt-candidate-profile-fixes` in `class-mt-plugin.php`
2. Remove the `wpautop()` wrappers from the template files
3. Revert icon class changes in templates

## Notes
- All changes are non-destructive and can be easily reverted
- The fixes CSS file uses `!important` declarations to ensure overrides work properly
- Original functionality is preserved while improving visual presentation
