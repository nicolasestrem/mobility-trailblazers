# Bug Fixes and Code Quality Improvements
## Date: 2025-08-17
## Version: 2.5.2

## Overview
This document details the bug fixes and code quality improvements made to address issues identified in the codebase audit.

## Bugs Fixed 🐛

### 1. Fatal Error Prevention in MT_Evaluation_Ajax::get_evaluation_details()
**File:** `includes/ajax/class-mt-evaluation-ajax.php` (lines 887-903)

**Issue:** Method could cause fatal error if related posts (jury member or candidate) were deleted.

**Fix:** Added comprehensive null checks and safe property access:
```php
// Check if posts exist to avoid fatal errors
$jury_member_title = ($jury_member && is_object($jury_member) && isset($jury_member->post_title)) 
    ? $jury_member->post_title 
    : __('Unknown (Deleted)', 'mobility-trailblazers');
```

**Impact:** Prevents fatal errors when viewing evaluations for deleted jury members or candidates.

### 2. Standardized Nonce Handling
**File:** `includes/ajax/class-mt-admin-ajax.php` (lines 109, 214, 321)

**Issue:** Export functions used inconsistent nonce names (`mt_export_candidates`, `mt_export_evaluations`, `mt_export_assignments`) instead of the standard `mt_admin_nonce`.

**Fix:** Changed all three export download methods to use `mt_admin_nonce`:
```php
// Before:
if (!isset($_GET['_wpnonce']) || !wp_verify_nonce($_GET['_wpnonce'], 'mt_export_candidates')) {

// After:
if (!isset($_GET['_wpnonce']) || !wp_verify_nonce($_GET['_wpnonce'], 'mt_admin_nonce')) {
```

**Impact:** Consistent security handling across all admin AJAX actions.

### 3. Proper Script Termination After Redirect
**File:** `includes/core/class-mt-i18n.php` (line 188)

**Issue:** Used `exit` instead of `wp_die()` after `wp_safe_redirect()`.

**Fix:** Replaced `exit` with `wp_die()`:
```php
wp_safe_redirect($redirect_url);
wp_die(); // Changed from exit
```

**Impact:** Allows WordPress shutdown hooks to run properly and follows WordPress best practices.

## Code Quality Improvements 🧐

### 4. Improved Variable Naming in MT_Coaching
**Files:** 
- `includes/admin/class-mt-coaching.php` (lines 82, 157, 209, 237)
- `templates/admin/coaching.php` (lines 15-19)

**Issue:** Variable `$stats` was misleading as it contained a complex data structure with jury statistics and other coaching data.

**Fix:** Renamed `$stats` to `$coaching_data` throughout:
```php
// Before:
$stats = $this->get_coaching_statistics();
foreach ($stats['jury_stats'] as $jury) {

// After:
$coaching_data = $this->get_coaching_statistics();
foreach ($coaching_data['jury_stats'] as $jury) {
```

**Impact:** Improved code readability and maintainability.

### 5. Removed Test Handler
**File:** `includes/ajax/class-mt-assignment-ajax.php` (lines 49, 949-951)

**Issue:** Test handler `test_handler()` was left in production code.

**Fix:** Removed the test handler action hook and method entirely.

**Impact:** Cleaner production code without test artifacts.

## Pending Improvements (Not Critical)

### Namespace Consistency
**Status:** Identified but not fixed in this iteration.
**Issue:** Inconsistent use of fully qualified namespace paths.
**Recommendation:** Standardize on using `use` statements at file top.

### Add Action Consistency  
**Status:** Identified but not fixed in this iteration.
**Issue:** Mixed use of `[__CLASS__, 'method']` and full class names.
**Recommendation:** Use `[__CLASS__, 'method']` consistently within same class.

### Incomplete process() Method
**Status:** Identified but not fixed in this iteration.
**File:** `includes/services/class-mt-assignment-service.php`
**Issue:** The `process()` method exists but is never called.
**Recommendation:** Either implement routing through process() or remove if unused.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Evaluation Details View:**
   - Create an evaluation
   - Delete the associated jury member or candidate post
   - Verify the evaluation details still display without fatal error

2. **Test Export Functions:**
   - Export candidates, evaluations, and assignments
   - Verify all exports work with standardized nonce

3. **Test Language Switching:**
   - Switch languages using the language switcher
   - Verify proper redirect without errors

4. **Test Coaching Dashboard:**
   - Access coaching dashboard
   - Send reminders
   - Export coaching report
   - Verify all functions work with renamed variables

## Deployment Notes

- No database changes required
- No data migration needed
- Backward compatible changes
- Clear browser cache after deployment
