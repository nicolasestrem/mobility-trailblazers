# UI Evaluation Table Improvements - 2025-08-17

## Overview
Fixed layout and spacing issues in the evaluation table to improve usability and readability.

## Problems Addressed

### 1. Candidate Names Too Close to Border
- Names were cramped against cell edges making them hard to read
- No proper padding in candidate cells

### 2. Missing Biography Display
- Candidate biographies/excerpts were not shown in the evaluation table
- Jury members couldn't see candidate descriptions while evaluating

### 3. Uncentered Rating Inputs
- Score input fields were not properly centered in their cells
- Inconsistent alignment made the interface look unprofessional

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Improved Candidate Cell Layout
```css
.mt-eval-candidate {
    text-align: left;
    padding: 8px 12px;
}
.mt-evaluation-table td.mt-eval-candidate {
    text-align: left;
    padding-left: 15px;
    padding-right: 15px;
}
```
- Added proper padding to create breathing room
- Left-aligned text for better readability
- Increased horizontal padding for candidate column

### 2. Biography Display Implementation
**PHP Template Update:**
```php
// Added to jury-rankings.php
$excerpt = get_the_excerpt($candidate->ID);
if ($excerpt) : ?>
    <div class="mt-candidate-bio">
        <?php echo esc_html(wp_trim_words($excerpt, 15, '...')); ?>
    </div>
<?php endif;
```

**CSS Styling:**
```css
.mt-eval-candidate .mt-candidate-bio {
    font-size: 12px;
    color: #6c757d;
    margin-top: 6px;
    font-style: italic;
    line-height: 1.4;
    display: block;
}
```
- Shows first 15 words of biography
- Styled with italic, smaller font
- Subtle gray color to not distract from main info

### 3. Centered Rating Inputs
```css
.mt-eval-score-input {
    width: 60px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    display: block;
    padding: 6px 4px;
}
```
- Increased width for better touch targets
- Used `margin: 0 auto` with `display: block` for centering
- Added vertical padding for improved clickability
