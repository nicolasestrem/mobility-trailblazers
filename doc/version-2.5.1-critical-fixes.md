# Version 2.5.1 Critical Fixes Documentation

## Date: 2025-08-17

## Overview
This document details the critical fixes applied in version 2.5.1 to resolve breaking issues introduced in version 2.5.0.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hero Section Height Issue
**Problem**: The hero section was taking up the entire viewport, making it difficult to access content below.

**Solution**:
- Modified `assets/css/candidate-profile-fixes.css`:
  - Added `max-height: 400px` constraint to `.mt-hero-section`
  - Adjusted padding from 30px/20px to 40px/30px for optimal spacing
  - Added height constraints to `.mt-hero-pattern`
  
- Modified `templates/frontend/single/single-mt_candidate.php`:
  - Reduced inline style padding from 80px/60px to 50px/40px
  - Added max-height constraint in inline styles

### 2. Evaluation Criteria Text Formatting
**Problem**: Text in evaluation criteria was bunched together without proper line breaks.

**Solution**:
- Modified `assets/css/candidate-profile-fixes.css`:
  - Changed `white-space` from `normal` to `pre-line` to preserve line breaks
  - Added `overflow-wrap: break-word` for better word breaking
  - Added specific BR element styling for proper line spacing

### 3. Top Ranked Candidates Color Contrast
**Problem**: Text on rank badges was unreadable due to poor color contrast.

**Solution**:
- Added to `assets/css/design-improvements-2025.css`:
  - Gold rank (#FFD700) now uses dark text (#1f2937) for contrast
  - Silver (#C0C0C0) and bronze (#CD7F32) maintain white text
  - Added text-shadow and font-weight for better visibility

### 4. Candidate Grid View Layout
**Problem**: Grid layout was broken with inconsistent card sizes and alignment.

**Solution**:
- Added to `assets/css/design-improvements-2025.css`:
  - Implemented proper CSS Grid with `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(280px, 1fr))`
  - Fixed card heights with `min-height: 320px`
  - Added image object-fit and consistent sizing
  - Implemented responsive breakpoints for mobile devices

### 5. Biography/Web Fields on Evaluation Pages
**Problem**: Initially reported as missing, but investigation showed they exist.

**Finding**: The fields are already properly implemented in `templates/frontend/jury-evaluation-form.php` (lines 174-185). No changes were required.
