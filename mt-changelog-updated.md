### Assignment Management System - Critical Bug Fixes

This release resolves critical issues preventing all buttons and features on the mt-assignment-management page from functioning properly.

#### Fixed

**JavaScript Variable Localization Issues**
- **Problem**: Assignment management buttons completely non-functional due to JavaScript variable mismatches
- **Root Cause**: Multiple naming inconsistencies between PHP localization and JavaScript expectations
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  1. Fixed `ajaxUrl` variable name mismatch (PHP used `ajax_url`, JS expected `ajaxUrl`)
  2. Corrected nonce name from `mt_admin_nonce` to `mt_ajax_nonce` to match AJAX handler expectations
  3. Fixed parameter name inconsistencies in AJAX calls (`candidateId` vs `candidate_id`)

**Database Schema Alignment**
- **Problem**: Repository methods using incorrect column names that don't match actual database table structure
- **Root Cause**: Repository code assumed different column names than what was actually created in the database
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Changed `assigned_at` to `assignment_date` in all repository methods
  - Changed `status` to `is_active` in all repository methods
  - Updated `create()`, `bulk_create()`, `find_all()`, and `get_statistics()` methods
  - Fixed column references in SQL queries throughout the repository

**Jury Member Data Source Fix**
- **Problem**: Assignment service was looking for jury members as users with role `mt_jury_member` instead of posts
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect assumption about how jury members are stored in the system
- **Fix**: Updated `get_active_jury_members()` method to query posts of type `mt_jury_member` instead of users

**Autoloader Interface Resolution**
- **Problem**: PHP Fatal error "Interface MT_Service_Interface not found" preventing assignment functionality
- **Root Cause**: Autoloader only looking for `class-` prefixed files, but interface files use `interface-` prefix
- **Fix**: Updated autoloader to handle both `class-` and `interface-` prefixes for interface files
- **Additional Fix**: Added manual interface loading fallback in service and repository classes for reliability

**Missing Service Methods**
- **Problem**: AJAX handlers calling methods that didn't exist in the assignment service
- **Fixes**:
  - Added `get_statistics()` method to provide comprehensive assignment statistics
  - Added `get_all_assignments_for_export()` method for CSV export functionality
  - Changed `create_assignment()` method visibility from `private` to `public`

**AJAX Handler Parameter Mismatches**
- **Problem**: Remove assignment functionality failing due to parameter name inconsistencies
- **Fix**: Updated AJAX handler to expect `candidateId` instead of `candidate_id` in remove_assignment method

#### Added

**Enhanced Debugging Support**
- Added comprehensive console logging to JavaScript for troubleshooting
- Debug messages for initialization, event binding, and button clicks
- Real-time feedback for AJAX operations and user interactions

**Comprehensive Statistics System**
- Total candidates, jury members, and assignments counts
- Assigned vs unassigned candidate tracking
- Per-jury member assignment statistics
- Real-time statistics updates via AJAX

**Export Functionality**
- Complete CSV export system for assignments

- Proper BOM encoding for Excel compatibility

#### Changed

**Repository Method Signatures**
- Updated all database column references to match actual schema
- Standardized parameter handling across all repository methods
- Improved error handling and validation

**Service Layer Integration**
- Enhanced assignment service with missing methods
- Improved error reporting and validation
- Better integration with repository layer

**JavaScript Architecture**

  - `assignment_date` instead of `assigned_at`
  - `is_active` instead of `status`
- Proper data type handling for boolean and datetime fields
- Consistent query structure across all methods

**AJAX Communication**
- Fixed nonce verification using correct action names

- **Fix**: Implemented batch processing with 50-record chunks and 10ms delays between batches

**Jury Dashboard Data Type Fix**
- **Problem**: PHP warnings "Attempt to read property on int" in jury dashboard
- **Root Cause**: `mt_get_assigned_candidates()` returns IDs but code expects objects
- **Fix**: Added proper conversion from candidate IDs to candidate objects using `get_posts()`

### Usage Instructions
1. Run `fix-jury-dashboard.php` to diagnose and fix assignment issues
2. Use Assignment Management page to create assignments: `admin.php?page=mt-assignment-management`
3. Ensure jury members are linked to user accounts
4. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
