## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

The platform implements multiple layers of security:

#### 1. **WordPress Security Integration**
- Nonce verification on all forms and AJAX requests
- Capability-based access control
- User role permissions management
- WordPress sanitization and escaping functions

#### 2. **Data Protection**
- Prepared SQL statements for all database queries
- Input sanitization and validation
- Output escaping for XSS prevention
- CSRF token protection on all state-changing operations

#### 3. **Authentication & Authorization**
- WordPress user authentication system
- Role-based access control (Administrator, Jury Member)
- Session management through WordPress core
- Secure password policies

#### 4. **Infrastructure Security**
- Docker containerization for isolated environments
- SSL/TLS encryption for data transmission
- Regular security updates through WordPress core
- Database access restrictions

### Security Headers

When deployed, ensure the following security headers are configured:

```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure from security researchers and users.

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security reports to: **security@mobility-trailblazers.com**
3. Encrypt sensitive information using our PGP key (available on request)

### Information to Include

Please provide the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF)
- Full paths of affected source files
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact assessment of the vulnerability
- Your recommendations for remediation

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receipt
- **Vulnerability Confirmation**: Within 5 business days
- **Security Patch Development**: Within 10-30 days depending on severity
- **Public Disclosure**: After patch is released and users have had time to update

### Severity Classification

We classify vulnerabilities according to the following severity levels:

| Severity | CVSS Score | Response Time | Example |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Critical | 9.0-10.0 | 24-48 hours | Remote code execution, authentication bypass |
| High | 7.0-8.9 | 3-5 days | SQL injection, privilege escalation |
| Medium | 4.0-6.9 | 7-14 days | XSS, information disclosure |
| Low | 0.1-3.9 | 30 days | Minor information leakage |

## Security Best Practices

### For Administrators

1. **Keep Software Updated**
   - WordPress Core: Update within 48 hours of release
   - Plugin Updates: Test in staging, then update production within 7 days
   - PHP Version: Maintain PHP 7.4+ (PHP 8.0+ recommended)

2. **Access Control**
   - Use strong passwords (minimum 12 characters)
   - Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) where possible
   - Regularly audit user accounts and permissions
   - Remove inactive jury member accounts

3. **Backup Strategy**
   - Daily automated database backups
   - Weekly full site backups
   - Store backups in secure, off-site location
   - Test restore procedures monthly

4. **Monitoring**
   - Enable WordPress debug logging (in development only)
   - Monitor error logs for suspicious activity
   - Use security plugins for additional monitoring
   - Regular security audits using the Diagnostics page

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   ```bash
   # Run security scans before commits
   composer security-scan
   
   # Check specific security aspects
   composer check-nonce      # Verify nonce usage
   composer check-escaping   # Check output escaping
   composer check-sql        # Verify SQL preparation
   ```

2. **Secure Coding Practices**
   - Always use WordPress nonces for forms and AJAX
   - Escape all output: `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`, `esc_url()`
   - Prepare all SQL queries: `$wpdb->prepare()`
   - Validate and sanitize all input data
   - Use capability checks: `current_user_can()`

3. **Testing Security**
   - Test with WordPress debug mode enabled
   - Verify all AJAX endpoints require authentication
   - Test role-based access restrictions
   - Validate input handling with edge cases

### For Jury Members

1. **Account Security**
   - Use unique, strong passwords
   - Do not share login credentials
   - Log out when finished evaluating
   - Report suspicious activity immediately

2. **Data Handling**
   - Do not download or share candidate data
   - Access the platform only from secure networks
   - Keep evaluation data confidential
   - Report any data access issues
