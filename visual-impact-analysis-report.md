## Conclusion

The Mobility Trailblazers WordPress plugin demonstrates excellent functionality and visual design across multiple viewport sizes. The core jury evaluation system works well, with particular strength in the desktop experience. Mobile responsiveness is functional but would benefit from touch-specific optimizations before the production launch.

The CSS architecture is well-structured and the WordPress integration follows best practices. With minor responsive refinements, particularly for mobile touch interactions, this plugin will provide an excellent user experience for the 24 jury members evaluating 50+ mobility innovation candidates.

**Overall Rating**: 8.5/10 - Production ready with recommended mobile optimizations.
