# Mobility Trailblazers WordPress Plugin

A comprehensive award management system for the "25 Mobility Trailblazers in 25" award platform, recognizing the best mobility shapers in the DACH region.

## 🚀 Overview

This WordPress plugin provides a complete solution for managing an awards program with:

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Docker Stack Configuration
```yaml
services:
  wordpress:     # Port 9989 - Main WordPress site
  wpcli:        # WordPress CLI for management
  db:           # MariaDB 11 database (Port 9306)
  redis:        # Redis cache (Port 9191)
  phpmyadmin:   # Database management (Port 9081)
```

## 📋 Features

### Award Management System
- **Three-phase selection process**: 2000 → 200 → 50 → 25 candidates
- **Category-based evaluation**:
  - Established Companies
  - Start-ups & New Makers
  - Infrastructure/Politics/Public Companies
- **Current Status**: 490+ candidates, 22 jury members

### Jury Evaluation Platform ✅
- **Secure jury member dashboard** with role-based access
- **Real-time evaluation statistics**
- **Five evaluation criteria** (1-10 scale each, 50 points total):
  - Mut & Pioniergeist (Courage & Pioneer Spirit)
  - Innovationsgrad (Innovation Degree)
  - Umsetzungskraft & Wirkung (Implementation & Impact)
  - Relevanz für Mobilitätswende (Mobility Transformation Relevance)
  - Vorbildfunktion & Sichtbarkeit (Role Model & Visibility)
- **100% Dashboard Consistency** between admin and frontend views

### Dashboard Consistency System ✅
- **Unified evaluation counting** across all interfaces
- **Automatic ID synchronization** (jury post IDs → user IDs)
- **Duplicate evaluation handling** with newest-wins strategy
- **Orphaned evaluation preservation** for data integrity
- **Real-time sync status monitoring** with admin notices

## 🔧 Recent Implementation (June 13, 2025)

### Dashboard Consistency Enhancement

#### Problem Solved
- Admin and frontend dashboards showed different evaluation counts
- Some evaluations used jury post IDs (549, 555, 558) instead of user IDs
- Duplicate entries caused database constraint violations
- Jury member deletion orphaned evaluations

#### Solution Implemented

1. **Enhanced Consistency Class** (`class-mt-jury-consistency.php`):
   ```php
   // Unified evaluation counting
   mt_get_user_evaluation_count($user_id)
   mt_has_jury_evaluated($user_id, $candidate_id)
   mt_get_user_evaluation($user_id, $candidate_id)
   ```

2. **Intelligent Sync System**:
   - Detects evaluations using jury post IDs
   - Handles duplicate entries (keeps newest)
   - Preserves orphaned evaluations
   - Transaction-based sync for data integrity

3. **Admin Interface Integration**:
   - Real-time sync status notices
   - One-click sync button
   - Detailed sync reporting
   - Handles jury member additions/deletions

4. **Database Improvements**:
   - Fixed missing `comments` column
   - Standardized on WordPress user IDs
   - Maintains unique constraints
   - Preserves historical data

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Komodo for stack management
- Access to server at 192.168.1.7

### 2. Deploy the Stack
```bash

docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Access Points
- **WordPress**: http://192.168.1.7:9989
- **phpMyAdmin**: http://192.168.1.7:9081
- **Admin Dashboard**: http://192.168.1.7:9989/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mt-jury-dashboard

## 📝 Usage Guide

### For Administrators

#### Managing Jury Members
```bash
# List all jury members
docker exec mobility_wpcli_STAGING wp user list --role=mt_jury_member

# Check evaluation counts
docker exec mobility_wpcli_STAGING wp eval '
$users = get_users(array("role" => "mt_jury_member"));
foreach ($users as $user) {
    $count = mt_get_user_evaluation_count($user->ID);
    echo "User {$user->ID} ({$user->display_name}): {$count} evaluations\n";
}
'
```

#### Sync Evaluation Data
1. Navigate to any MT admin page
2. Look for "Evaluation Data Sync Required" notice
3. Click "Fix Evaluation Data" to sync
4. Or use WP-CLI:
   ```bash
   docker exec mobility_wpcli_STAGING wp eval '
   if (class_exists("MT_Jury_Consistency")) {
       $consistency = MT_Jury_Consistency::get_instance();
       $result = $consistency->sync_all_evaluations();
       echo $result["message"];
   }
   '
   ```

### For Jury Members

1. **Login** with provided credentials
2. **Access Dashboard** via admin menu or frontend page
3. **Review Candidates** in your assigned list
4. **Evaluate** using the 5-criteria scoring system
5. **Track Progress** with real-time statistics

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Count Mismatch
```bash
# Check for sync issues
docker exec mobility_wpcli_STAGING wp eval '
if (class_exists("MT_Jury_Consistency")) {
    $consistency = MT_Jury_Consistency::get_instance();
    $issues = $consistency->check_sync_issues();
    echo "Sync issues: " . $issues["total"] . "\n";
    echo "- High IDs: " . $issues["high_ids"] . "\n";
    echo "- Orphaned: " . $issues["orphaned"] . "\n";
}
'
```

### Database Integrity Check
```bash
# Check for duplicate evaluations
docker exec mobility_wpcli_STAGING wp eval '
global $wpdb;
$table = $wpdb->prefix . "mt_candidate_scores";
$duplicates = $wpdb->get_results("
    SELECT candidate_id, jury_member_id, COUNT(*) as count
    FROM $table
    GROUP BY candidate_id, jury_member_id, evaluation_round
    HAVING count > 1
");
if ($duplicates) {
    echo "Found " . count($duplicates) . " duplicate entries\n";
} else {
    echo "No duplicates found\n";
}
'
```

### Backup Before Major Operations
```bash
# Full database backup
docker exec mobility_mariadb_STAGING mysqldump -uroot -pRt9mK3nQ8xY7bV5cZ2wE4rT6yU1i wordpress_db > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Evaluation table only
docker exec mobility_mariadb_STAGING mysqldump -uroot -pRt9mK3nQ8xY7bV5cZ2wE4rT6yU1i wordpress_db wp_mt_candidate_scores > scores_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
```
