## Installation

1. Upload the `mobility-trailblazers` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. The plugin will automatically:
   - Create necessary database tables
   - Set up required user roles and capabilities
   - Configure default settings

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.8 or higher
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL 5.7 or higher
- Elementor Pro (optional, for widget functionality)

## Database Architecture

The plugin uses a hybrid approach for data storage:

### Custom Tables
- `wp_mt_votes` - Public voting data
- `wp_mt_candidate_scores` - Jury scoring data (legacy)
- `wp_mt_evaluations` - Detailed jury evaluations
- `wp_mt_jury_assignments` - Candidate-to-jury assignments
- `wp_vote_reset_logs` - Voting reset audit trail
- `wp_mt_vote_backups` - Voting data backups

### Post Meta Storage
The plugin maintains backward compatibility by supporting assignment data in post meta as a fallback when custom tables are not available.

## Quick Start

### Setting Up Awards

1. Navigate to **Mobility Trailblazers** ‚Üí **Categories**
2. Create award categories (e.g., "Innovation Leader", "Sustainability Champion")
3. Add candidates via **Mobility Trailblazers** ‚Üí **Add New Candidate**
4. Create jury members and their user accounts
5. Assign candidates to jury members for evaluation

### Managing Assignments

The plugin offers two methods for managing jury assignments:

1. **Manual Assignment**: Select specific candidates for each jury member
2. **Auto-Assignment**: Use balanced or random algorithms to distribute candidates

### Evaluation Process

1. Jury members log in to their dashboard
2. They see their assigned candidates
3. For each candidate, they provide scores (1-10) on five criteria:
   - **Mut & Pioniergeist** (Courage & Pioneer Spirit)
   - **Innovationsgrad** (Innovation Degree)
   - **Umsetzungskraft & Wirkung** (Implementation & Impact)
   - **Relevanz f√ºr Mobilit√§tswende** (Mobility Transformation Relevance)
   - **Vorbildfunktion & Sichtbarkeit** (Role Model & Visibility)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Database Tables Not Created
**Symptom**: Errors mentioning missing tables like `wp_mt_evaluations` or `wp_mt_jury_assignments`

**Solution**: The plugin now includes automatic table creation. Simply:
1. Deactivate and reactivate the plugin, OR
2. Visit any admin page - tables will be created automatically

#### Administrator Missing Capabilities
**Symptom**: "Administrator role missing edit_others_mt_jury_member capability" errors

**Solution**: The plugin now self-heals capabilities. Just:
1. Visit any WordPress admin page
2. Capabilities are automatically repaired on each page load

#### Assignments Not Showing
**Symptom**: Jury members don't see assigned candidates

**Solution**: The plugin now includes fallback methods:
1. If the assignments table exists, it will be used
2. If not, the plugin falls back to post meta storage
3. Both methods work seamlessly

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in `wp-config.php`:
```php
define('MT_DEBUG', true);
```

This will:
- Enable detailed error logging
- Show diagnostic information in the admin area
- Help troubleshoot issues
