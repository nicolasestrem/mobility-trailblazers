# Security Improvements and Code Quality Fixes

## Security Fixes Implemented (HIGH Priority)

### 1. CSV Injection Protection (class-mt-import-handler.php)
- Added `sanitize_csv_value()` method to prevent formula injection attacks
- Escapes potentially dangerous characters (=, +, -, @, tab, carriage return)
- Prevents DDE attacks by escaping pipe character
- Logs potential injection attempts for security monitoring

### 2. Path Traversal Prevention (class-mt-import-handler.php)  
- Added file path validation using `realpath()`
- Ensures imported files are within WordPress uploads directory
- Prevents directory traversal attacks via malicious file paths

### 3. Username Enumeration Mitigation (class-mt-import-handler.php)
- Enhanced `generate_username()` with random suffixes
- Prevents attackers from guessing usernames
- Adds 4-character random string to usernames

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Removed Duplicate AJAX Handlers (class-mt-import-export.php)
- Deprecated `ajax_import_csv()` method
- Consolidated to single MT_CSV_Import_Ajax handler
- Prevents race conditions and duplicate processing

### 2. CSS Architecture Documentation
- Created COLOR-TOKEN-CONSOLIDATION.md for color system mapping
- Documents 54 CSS files and their token usage
- Provides migration path for CSS consolidation

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Created EMAIL-GUIDE.md documenting removed email functionality
- Updated IMPORT-EXPORT-GUIDE.md to reflect 3 main classes
- Updated DEPENDENCY-INJECTION-GUIDE.md with assignment service examples

### 4. Template Loader Improvements (class-mt-template-loader.php)
- Added TODO for removing candidate-single-hotfix.css in v2.5.39
- Documented CSS consolidation plan
