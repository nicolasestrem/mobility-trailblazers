# DEPRECATED: MT_Enhanced_Profile_Importer

This class has been deprecated and its functionality has been consolidated into MT_Import_Handler.

## Migration Guide:

### parse_evaluation_criteria()
This method has been moved to:
```php
MT_Import_Handler::parse_evaluation_criteria($description)
```

### import_csv()
Use:
```php
$handler = new MT_Import_Handler();
$result = $handler->process_csv_import($file, 'candidates', $update_existing);
```

### get_field_mapping()
Field mappings are now constants in MT_Import_Handler:
```php
MT_Import_Handler::CANDIDATE_FIELD_MAPPING
```

## Files Updated:
- includes/ajax/class-mt-import-ajax.php - Now uses MT_Import_Handler
- includes/admin/class-mt-candidate-columns.php - Now uses MT_Import_Handler
- includes/admin/class-mt-import-export.php - Now uses MT_Import_Handler
- templates/admin/import-profiles.php - Now uses MT_Import_Handler

## Reason for Deprecation:
Having multiple import classes created confusion and maintenance issues. All import functionality has been consolidated into MT_Import_Handler for consistency.
